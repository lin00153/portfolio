Things I learned during doing this web portfolio:
1. **Prototype for web portfolio is essential.**
 Without the prototype I've done in my UX Design course, it may take longer for me to consider the layout of my portfolio.
2. **Less is more.**
Before I start my portfolio, I always think too much so I don't know where to start. So, I found that for web development less is more. After you have a clear and organized layout, I can add more features to it instead of thinking too much at the first place.

**All the images and illustrations created by myself, expect for icons, they comes from [Boxicons](https://boxicons.com/)**
